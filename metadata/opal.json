    "description": "Ethiopian opal is a type of precious opal that is found exclusively in Ethiopia. It is known for its vibrant play of color, which can include flashes of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. The colors are caused by the diffraction of light as it passes through microscopic silica spheres in the opal.",
